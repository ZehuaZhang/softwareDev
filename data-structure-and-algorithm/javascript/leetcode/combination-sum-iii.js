/*
Find all valid combinations of k numbers that sum up to n such that the following conditions are true:

Only numbers 1 through 9 are used.
Each number is used at most once.
Return a list of all possible valid combinations. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: k = 3, n = 7
Output: [[1,2,4]]
Explanation:
1 + 2 + 4 = 7
There are no other valid combinations.
Example 2:

Input: k = 3, n = 9
Output: [[1,2,6],[1,3,5],[2,3,4]]
Explanation:
1 + 2 + 6 = 9
1 + 3 + 5 = 9
2 + 3 + 4 = 9
There are no other valid combinations.
Example 3:

Input: k = 4, n = 1
Output: []
Explanation: There are no valid combinations.
Using 4 different numbers in the range [1,9], the smallest sum we can get is 1+2+3+4 = 10 and since 10 > 1, there are no valid combination.
Example 4:

Input: k = 3, n = 2
Output: []
Explanation: There are no valid combinations.
Example 5:

Input: k = 9, n = 45
Output: [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]]
Explanation:
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45
There are no other valid combinations.
 

Constraints:

2 <= k <= 9
1 <= n <= 60
