263. Ugly Number

An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
Example 3:

Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= n <= 231 - 1

function isUgly(n: number): boolean {
  for (const a of [2, 3, 5]) {
      while (n && n % a === 0) {
          n /= a;
      }
  }

  return n === 1;
};
